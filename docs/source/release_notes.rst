Release notesconsistency
=============

1.0.3 (06.11.2023)
-------------------------------------------------
- Added ``filterby`` and ``filter_lambda`` parameters to ``li.pl.interactions`` and ``li.pl.target_metrics`` to allow filtering of interactions and metrics, respectively.

- Removed unnecessary ``stat`` parameter from ``li.pl.contributions``

- Added tests to ensure both ``lr_bivar`` and single-cell methods throw an exception when the resource is not covered by the data.

- ``estimate_elbow`` will add the errors and the number of patterns to ``.uns`` when inplace is True.

- When ``groupby`` or ``sample_key`` are not categorical liana will now print a warning before converting them to categorical. Related to #28

- Various documentation improvements, including using ``docrep`` to ensure consistency.

- ``__version__`` will now correctly reflect the version in pyproject.toml

- Exported repeated value definitions to ``_constants.py``

- Renamed some ``*_separator`` columns to ``*_sep`` for consistency.

- Added ``li.ut.query_bandwidth`` to query the bandwidth of the spatial connectivities (used in spatial bivariate tutorial)

- Added **pre-commit** hooks adapted from scverse's cookiecutter.


1.0.2 (13.10.2023)
-------------------------------------------------
- Added as ``seed`` param to ``find_causalnet``, used to a small amount of noise to the nodes in to avoid obtaining multiple solutions to the same problem when multiple equal solutions are possible.

- Updated ``installation.rst`` to refer to ``pip install liana[common]`` and ``liana[full]`` for extended installations.

- Fixed a bug which would cause ``bivar`` to crash when an AnnData object was passed

Merged #61 including the following:

- Added ``standardize`` parameter to spatial_neighbors, used to standardize the spatial connectivities such that each spot's proximity weights to 1. Required for non-standardized metrics (such as ``product``)

- Fixed edge case in ``assert_covered`` to handle interactions not present in ``adata`` nor the resource.

- Added simple product (scores ranging from -inf, +inf) and norm_product (scores ranging from -1, +1).
The former is a simple product of x and y, while the latter standardized each variable to be between 0 and 1, following weighing by spatial proximity, and then multiplies them.
Essentially, it diminishes the effect of spatial proximity on the score, while still taking it into account. We observed that this is useful for e.g. border zones.


1.0.1 Stable Release (30.09.2023)
-------------------------------------------------
- Bumped CORNETO version and it's now installed via PyPI.

1.0.0a2 (19.09.2023)

- Interactions names in ``tileplot`` and ``dotplot`` will now be sorted according to ``orderby`` when used; related to #55

- Added ``filter_view_markers`` function to filter view markers considered background in MOFAcellular tutorial

- Added ``keep_stats`` parameter to ``adata_to_views`` to enable pseudobulk stats to be kept.

- Replace ``intra_groupby`` and ``extra_groupby`` with ``maskby`` in misty.
  The spots will now only be filtered according to ``maskby``, such that both intra and extra both contain the same spots.
  The extra views are multiplied by the spatial connectivities prior to masking and the model being fit

- Merge MOFAcell improvements; related to #42 and #29

- Targets with zero variance will no longer be modeled by misty.

- Resolve #46 - refactored misty's pipeline

- Resolved logging and package import verbosity issues related to #43

- Minor Readme & tutorial text improvements.


1.0.0a1 Biorxiv (30.07.2023)
---------------------------------------------------------

- ``positive_only`` in bivariate metrics was renamed to ``mask_negatives`` will now mask only negative-negative/low-low interactions, and not negative-positive interactions.

- Replaced MSigDB with transcription factor activities in MISTy's tutorial

- Enable sorting according to ascending order in misty-related plots

- Enable ``cmap`` to be passed to tileplot & dotplots

- Minor Readme & tutorial improvements.


1.0.0a0 (27.07.2023) LIANA+ Release
---------------------------------------------------------

LIANA becomes LIANA+.

Major changes have been made to the repository, however the API visible to the user should be largely consistent with previous versions, except minor exceptions:
- ``li.fun.generate_lr_geneset`` is now called via ``li.rs.generate_lr_geneset``

- the old 'li.funcomics' model is now renamed to something more general: ``li.utils``

- ``get_factor_scores`` and ``get_variable_loadings`` were moved to ``li.utils``


LIANA+ includes the following new features:

Spatial
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- A sklearn-based implementation to learn spatially-informed multi-view models, i.e. [MISTy](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-022-02663-5) models.

- A new tutorial that shows how to use LIANA+ to build and run MISTy models.

- Five vectorized local spatially-informed bivariate clustering and similarity metrics, such as [Moran's R](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.08.19.504616v1.full), Cosine, Jaccard, Pearson, Spearman. As well as a numba-compiled [Masked Spearman](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-020-0885-x) local score.

- A new tutorial that shows how to use LIANA+ to compute spatially-informed bivariate metrics, permutations-based p-values, interaction categoriez, as well as
how to summarize those into patterns using NMF.

- A radial basis kernel is implemented to calculate spot/cell connectivities (spatial connectivities); this is used by the spatially-informed bivariate metrics and MISTy.
It mirrors [squidpy's](https://squidpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) ``sq.gr.spatial_neighbors`` function, and is hence interchangeable with it.


Handling multiple modalities
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- LIANA+ will now work with multi-modal data, i.e. it additionally support MuData objects as well as AnnData objects.
The API visible to the user is the same, but the underlying implementation is different.

- These come with a new tutorial that shows how to use LIANA+ with multi-modal (CITE-Seq) data, along with inbuilt transformations.

- The same API is also adapted by the local bivariate metrics, i.e. they can also be used with multi-modal data.


Multi-conditions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- A utility function has been added that will take any dataframe with various statistics and append it to information from AnnData objects;
thus creating a multi-condition dataframe in the format of LIANA.

- A new tutorial that shows how to use PyDESeq2 together with this utility function has been added, essentially a tutorial on "Hypothesis-driven CCC".

Visualizations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- A tileplot (``li.pl.tileplot``) has been added to better visualize ligands and receptors independently.

- MISTy-related visualizations have been added to vislualize view contributions and performance, and interaction coefficients/importances.

- A simple plot ``li.pl.connectivity`` is added to show spatial connectivities

Others
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- A Causal Network inference function has been added to infer downstream signalling networks. This is currently placed in the tutorial with PyDESeq2.

- An elbow approximation approach has been added to the NMF module, to help with the selection of the number of patterns.

- Various utility functions to simplify AnnData extraction/conversion, Matrix transformations, etc (added to ``li.ut``)

Note: this is just an overview of the new features, for details please refer to the tutorials, API, and documentation.
